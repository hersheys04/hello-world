My Apology in Advance

HEY GUYS!! I'm new here but I have a few things to say, like I like the color Navy Blue and I prefer Starbucks and Icecream more than apples and excersize. I want to just say, if this stuff is horrible, don't blame it on me, blame it on dominik johann(aka sno) for getting me on here! JK! Don't go blaming people..... but I certainly hope you like anything I create, and PLEASE feel free to give feedback so I can adjust and refine the horrible attempts about to be made......     THX!
